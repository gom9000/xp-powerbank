# PowerBank eXPerience
A series of simple experiences on powering multiple classic 9V stomp box guitar pedals.<br>
The type of power source leads to classifying this kind of power-supply (powerbank) devices as follows:

- the power source is an external DC adapter (stabilized or not), or low-voltage AC adapter, connected to the mains
- the power source is directly the mains, and we need a transformer to reduce the voltage (and, obviously, we need to work with mains hi-voltage!)

Within the prevoius cassifications, it is possible to determine some features that a powerbank device would be nice to have:

- a lot of output lines
- separate grounds for each output line
- separate regulations for each output line
- current limiter on each output line
- load reverse polarity protection
- DC source reverse polarity protection (only when power source is a DC adapter to the mains)
- a power plug to connect other devices in a daisy chain (only when power source is a DC/AC adapter to the mains)


## eXPeriences
Below are some design experiences I made to power my audio stomp box and other small 9V devices.<br>
The 3-digit number code at the end of the names indicates: the first digit is the number of separate grounds of the device,
the second digit is the number of output lines for each separate ground, the third digit is the value of the output voltage.
